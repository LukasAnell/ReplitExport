Computers run the world. They let everything function, yet many people don't know how they work at all. When you see a computer, the first thing that comes to mind is probably productivity or gaming. While these are common uses for computers, the most common is for computations. Computers all over the world are constantly working in huge data centers to compute or organize data. This data comes from the internet, satellites, and much more. In everyday life, computers are used everywhere, at work, at home, at the store, outside. We may not realize it, but they are a huge part of our lives. Even though they do so much, many people don't get to take a look inside at the components that make it work. Learning about and understanding the basic components inside a computer helps us view the world differently.
